    One of the basic strengths of JavaFX is its ability to let you easily create
    complicated GUIs with all the classic user interface gizmos everyone knows and loves.(??!??)

    Thus, JavaFX provides a full range of controls â€” dozens of them in fact, including
    the classics such as buttons, labels, text boxes, check boxes, drop-down lists, and
    menus, as well as more exotic controls such as tabbed panes and accordion panes.

    /* !!!! NOTE:
        Where JavaFX begins to shine is in its ability to allow you to easily improve the
        appearance of your user interface by using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS makes
        it easy to customize many aspects of the appearance of your user interface controls
        by placing all the formatting information in a separate file dubbed a style sheet.

        // Besides CSS, JavaFX offers many other capabilities. For example:
        String a = "1. Visual effects";
        String b = "2. Animation";
        String c = "3. 3-D objects";
        String d = "4. Touch interface";

        System.out.println(a + "\n" +
                "\t" + b + "\n\t\t" + c + "\n\t\t\t" + d);
